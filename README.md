- Module 12 Challenge
- Steph Abegg

For this moduleâ€™s Challenge, we were tasked with importing a JSON file of food establishment ratings data to a MongoDB database and conducting analysis to help a food magazine make decisions about their future articles. This Challenge had two Deliverables:

1. Deliverable 1: A Jupyter notebook ([NoSQL_setup.ipynb](NoSQL_setup.ipynb)) containing code that imports the data and sets up and updates the uk_food database.

2. Deliverable 2: A Jupyter notebook ([NoSQL_analysis.ipynb](NoSQL_analysis.ipynb)) containing code that performs the exploratory analysis queries in the database.
